# Shopping Cart
## The Odin Project
This project uses the https://fakestoreapi.com/ 
to display a demo of a shop in which you can see a 
home page, a shop in which to select the products you want
and the cart page.
I used React router (routing, Outlets and outlet context), tanStack library to make fetching easier and made an infinite slider in the homepage.
